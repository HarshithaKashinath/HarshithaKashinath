### 🧪 Academic Project

**ETL Pipeline for E-Commerce Data**  
As part of my graduate coursework, I designed and built an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas to process and analyze e-commerce sales data.  
The pipeline handled data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation using SQL, and was optimized for performance and reliability to support large datasets with minimal downtime.
